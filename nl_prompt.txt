Translate the following text to First Order Logic. Give your response in a format that can be 
understood by prover9 as an input file. For reference, here is a sample prover9 input file: 
assign(max_seconds, 30).

assign(new_constants, 1).

assign(max_weight,25).

% This proves distributivity from a Boolean algebra basis.

formulas(sos).

  x v (y v z) = y v (x v z).
  x ^ y = (x' v y')'.
  x v x' = y v y'.
  (x v y') ^ (x v y) = x.

end_of_list.

set(restrict_denials).

formulas(goals).

  x ^ (y v z) = (x ^ y) v (x ^ z) # label(distributivity_1).

end_of_list.

and here is the natural language prompt that your task is to translate into first order logic as a prover9 input file.
Ensure that your response can be directly runnable as a prover9 input file and doesn't contain any additional symbols.:

No professional athlete could have poor physical fitness.
If a professional athlete has good physical fitness, they are recruited by some teams.
A player recruited by some teams should be well-known.
If Michael Jordan is a professional athlete, then the same for LeBron James.
Tom Brady is a professional athlete.

Aswer the question: Is the following statement true, false, or unknown?
LeBron James is well-known.
