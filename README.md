This repository contains an implementation of the symbol logic LLM discussed in this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12295 to translate natural language into first order logic. The alogirthm first runs natural language text through an LLM through langchain and then runs prover9 on it to factcheck it: https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/prover9/ (this part not yet implemented), and then runs it through an entailment result interpreter (please review research paper attached above) to translate FOL back into NL (also not implemented yet). Here is an image of a visualization of this process (note: the highlighted part is relavant for First Order Logic). For more information, please review the research paper linked above.
